## 🧠 Overview  
**Autodesk Fabrication** is a comprehensive software solution designed for MEP contractors, mechanical, plumbing and HVAC professionals, and construction detailers — offering tools for accurate detailing, estimating, and project coordination within CAD/BIM workflows.  

The software helps convert 3D building models into fabrication-ready drawings, create precise takeoffs, and manage project materials with detailed cost estimation. With Fabrication, you can ensure that your designs align with real-world manufacturing and construction requirements, while streamlining the workflow from design to fabrication.  

Using a combination of CAD and BIM data, Fabrication allows users to coordinate construction-ready models, generate accurate bills of materials, and prepare detailed fabrication drawings — all within a unified Windows-based environment.

## Additional Information for Windows Users  
Autodesk Fabrication is built to support real-world construction workflows — from engineering design to shop‑floor fabrication. It brings together design, detailing, and project estimation into one integrated platform, reducing manual errors and improving efficiency.  

The software is especially useful for MEP contractors, detailing firms, and BIM coordinators who need to transform conceptual or architectural models into precise, build-ready documentation. Fabrication helps bridge the gap between CAD/BIM design stages and practical manufacturing or assembly — making project handoffs smoother and reducing the chance of mistakes on site.  

With support for detailed material takeoffs, cost analysis, and generation of shop drawings, **Autodesk Fabrication** streamlines the path from design to production — allowing teams to plan, estimate, and build more confidently and accurately on Windows systems.
